# Maze solver (Game)

## Description

This is a terminal-based C++ application (kind of a game) that uses backtracking to solve a 3-stage maze.
Everything is pure C++ so it's platform agnostic (probably) (actually probably not BUT IT COULD BE). It's more of a showcase than an actual 
playable game

The Super Mario Bros. theme wasn't my choice :l

Note: croi if you're reading this kindly piss off :)
